# Build Five Programs

## Overview

This repository contains five different shell scripts developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp challenge "Build Five Programs." Each script demonstrates various programming concepts and skills using Bash, a widely-used Unix shell and command language. The final script, `five.sh`, is used to run all the other scripts sequentially.

## Programs Included

1. **Bingo Game (`bingo.sh`)**
   - **Description:** This script simulates a simple Bingo game. It generates random numbers and checks for winning conditions. Users can interact with the script to simulate playing a game of Bingo.
   - **File:** `bingo.sh`

2. **Questionnaire (`questionnaire.sh`)**
   - **Description:** This script presents the user with a series of questions. It collects the responses and outputs them at the end. It's a basic demonstration of user interaction and input handling in Bash.
   - **File:** `questionnaire.sh`

3. **Fortune Teller (`fortune.sh`)**
   - **Description:** This script acts as a fortune teller. Users can ask yes-or-no questions, and the script responds with random answers selected from a predefined set of responses.
   - **File:** `fortune.sh`

4. **Countdown Timer (`countdown.sh`)**
   - **Description:** This script performs a countdown from a user-specified number of seconds. It provides a simple way to implement timers using loops and sleep commands in Bash.
   - **File:** `countdown.sh`

5. **Run All Scripts (`five.sh`)**
   - **Description:** This script serves as a master script that runs all four of the above scripts in sequence. It is a convenient way to execute all the programs without needing to run each one individually.
   - **File:** `five.sh`
